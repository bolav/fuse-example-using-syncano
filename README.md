# Using Parse with Fuse Example
Example project to accompany the "Using Parse with Fuse" Fuse tutorial video. This is a super simple app using [Parse](https://www.parse.com) as a backend service, where anyone can simply post text, and anyone else can see that text. All relevant code is in the `MainView.ux` file.

## Fuse version
This example was produced with Fuse (beta) v0.5.7001 (September 22, 2015).

## Branches
The "finished product" is on the `master` branch, and the template I started with in the video is on the `starting-template` branch.
